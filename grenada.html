                        Grenada is a small independent island in the Carribbean sea located northeast of the Venezuelan Coast, sandwiched between St.Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. Grenada is actually made up of three islands: the mainland, Carriacou, and Petite Martinique. Fun fact: The main island is only 134.6 square miles (which is 0.2 square miles smaller than the city of Atlanta!). Despite it's small size, its people are known to have some of the most genuine smiles and biggest hearts. It's primary exports are mace and nutmeg which is why it is proudly known as the Carribbean's Spice Island.</p>

                        Before the colonization, the island was inhabited by the indigenous peoples originating from South America. After much resistance from the island's original inhabitants, France successfully wretched control over the island in 1649 and began the process of colonization which involved the importation of African slaves for agricultural labor. In 1763, France relinquished control over Grenada to the British. However, in 1967 its people were granted full autonomy of the island while remaining an associated state with Britain. Independence was fully granted to the island in February of 1974, under the leadership of Eric Gairy--Grenada's first prime-minister--who would later be overthrown in a revloutionary movement that gripped the hearts of the people.

                        <br>

                        On March 13, 1979, Eric Gairy's tyrannical government was overthrown by the country's main opposition party--The New Jewel Movement (NJM)--in a Marxist revolutionary struggle led by its beloved leader Maurice Bishop. Economically burdened by oppression from its imperialist masters, the popular movement was formed with the goals of creating a new economic order that would free the country from exploitation by the imperialist First World and rightfully restore economic benefit into the hands of the toiling people. At the time of the revolution, the Grenadian National Treasury had only $24 dollars to its name and the cost of living was ~200% more than the averge household's income due to the country's inability to nationalize its own industries under Gairy's rule. Under Bishop's leadership, the People's Revolutionary Government (PRG), made massive gains for the people of Grenada with transformative policies that cultivated major progress within areas such as women's rights, education, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and the overall economy. During his time in office (4 years), unemployment was  reduced from 49% to 14%, GDP per capita nearly doubled, and the infant mortality rate was reduced from 29% to 14.8%. Education and healthcare became free for all, and income tax was abolished for 30% of the lowest paid workers. Unfortunately, this period of liberation for the Grenadian people did not last long. The Marxist line of the new Grendian government was of great concern to the U.S. and the U.K. as well as its fast-growing relations with the U.S.S.R. and Cuba. As a result, attempts to destablize Grenada's governement included the blocking of loans from the IMF and World Bank (by U.S. influence), suspension of economic "assistance" by the U.K., and operations carried out by the CIA such as the bombing of an NJM meeting in 1980 (assassination attempt on Maurice Bishop) and infiltration of leadership to sow discord which ulitmately lead to the assassination of MB on October 19, 1983 spearheaded by Benard Coard, the Deputy Prime Minister and co-leader of the PRG. This rapid deteriation of the Grendian govt. presented the perfect opening for the U.S. governement's invasion of Grenada on October 25, 1983, during which the U.S. navy bombed a civilian hospital. After the invasion, the PRG was no more and a government under the leadership of General-Governor Paul Scoon (who had secretly signaled to the U.S. government support of the invasion prior to) was instated. Despite the complete destruction of Grenada's self-determined government under the PRG, its legacy and that of its fearless leader--Mauric Bishop--still lives on in the hearts of many Grenadians today.
